White Boxing for VR project with the topic "Christ-kindl booth" in regular 3D Poject. Krampus fight: Fight against Krampus and get the candy from Nikolaus. 

foreach, list, enum 

Konnte nicht richtig playtesten, NikolausStickAttack Isn't needed in VR.
Stick should be attached to Hand but I made the Game for 3D so it's put on the Camera.
Krampus doesn't attack back, no Display of the current task.
